# OTP Input 
## ðŸš€ OTP Input Component ðŸš€

I've just completed a coding challenge where I created a robust OTP (One-Time Password) input component using React.js.Check it out:

##ðŸ”’ OTP Input Component

The OTP input field accepts exactly 6 numbers.

It only allows numbers as valid input.

You can use Backspace, Delete, Shift + Tab, Left Arrow Key, and Right Arrow Key for navigation and operations.

It supports paste functionality if the input is correct (6 numbers).

The Submit button is only activated when the entered OTP length is equal to 6.

When an input is active, it's highlighted in yellow.
