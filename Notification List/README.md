## ðŸš€ Just built a Custom Notification Component in React! ðŸ“£

I'm excited to share my latest project where I created a custom Notification Component using React. This component allows you to display different types of notifications (INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR) and automatically dismisses them after 2 seconds. ðŸ•’

### Key Features:

Custom hook for managing notifications.

Easy-to-use function for displaying notifications.

Support for different notification types.

Auto-dismissal of notifications.

Completely built with React.
